<p> This repository contains the final project for my Programming 3 course, a complete package delivery management system built using Java. The system integrates several advanced technologies to manage package records, employee assignments, reporting tools, and real-time map functionalities. The main objective of this project was to design and implement a robust, real-world application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, SQL databases, and external libraries to handle report generation, graphical visualization, and enhanced user interface components. </p>

<h1 align="center">Objective</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Apply core <b>OOP principles:</b> encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
  <li>Develop a real-world system to <b>register, update, and deliver packages</b> efficiently.</li>
  <li>Assign and track package deliveries by <b>responsible employees.</b></li>
  <li>Generate professional reports in <b>PDF and Excel formats.</b></li>
  <li>Integrate <b>external APIs</b> to enhance functionality and <b>improve the user experience.</b></li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">How to Use</h1>

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jordanmedinaortiz/package-delivery-system-java.git
   cd package-delivery-system-java
  
2. Set up the Database
   <ul>
     <li>Import the provided SQL file into your local MySQL or PostgreSQL server.</li>
     <li>Configure database credentials in the project's connection class.</li>
   </ul>

3. Compile the project
   <p>Use your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ or NetBeans) or compile manually:</p>
   
   ```sh
   javac -cp "lib/*" -d bin src/*.java

4. Run the application
  <p>Ensure all dependencies (libraries and database) are correctly linked:</p>
   
    ```sh
    java -cp "bin:lib/*" Main

5. Navigate the System
   <ul>
     <li>Login or register as an admin or delivery employee.</li>
     <li>Register packages, assign them, track deliveries, and generate reports from the GUI.</li>
   </ul>

<p>This project was developed individually as a final deliverable for Programming 3, representing a complete real-world Java application. It showcases not only technical implementation but also a focus on usability, scalability, and performance.</p>
